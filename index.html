          As the Owner and Dog Trainer at StonePaw Training, I've honed my expertise in the art of dog training.

Within the span of just one year, our combined dedication and passion led to a level of success that supported two incomes.
          <br><br>
          Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with dogs of diverse breeds, sizes, and temperaments, where my approach has always been rooted in positive reinforcement techniques. I take pride in my ability to connect with these four-legged companions, understanding their unique needs and tailoring training programs that enhance their behavior and obedience.

          In addition to my work with dogs, I've taken a proactive stance in website development, where I've been responsible for maintaining a user-friendly online platform. This endeavor involves continuous updates and improvements to ensure that our clients have easy access to valuable information and resources.

          <p class="experience__description">
            As Owner and Operations Manager at DogWorld Park, I was entrusted with the comprehensive management of the park, which encompassed numerous critical facets of its operation. This challenging role provided me with the opportunity to make a significant impact on the park's growth and development.
            <br><br>
            One of the most significant achievements during my tenure was leading the transformation of a business that was losing $13,000 per month into a thriving enterprise that achieved profitability within just six months of assuming control. This rapid turnaround was the result of strategic decision-making, dedication to high standards, and a proactive approach to problem-solving.
            <br><br>

            My responsibilities extended to property maintenance, ensuring that the park provided a safe and welcoming environment for both dogs and their owners. I also played a key role in overseeing dog examinations, guaranteeing the health and well-being of the pets in our care. My management of day-to-day park operations included leading a dynamic team of up to 6 employees, where I cultivated a culture of teamwork, accountability, and excellence.
            <br><br>

            Beyond the park's physical and operational aspects, I also managed the digital presence of DogWorld. This encompassed website development, ensuring that the online platform was user-friendly and effectively communicated our services and values to our clients. In addition, I orchestrated marketing campaigns that extended our reach and made a positive impact on our brand's visibility.
            <br><br>

            A pivotal component of my role involved the management of a complex software system that streamlined our daily operations. This software played a critical role in organizing dog records, maintaining vet data, and ensuring the smooth functioning of the park. The deployment and management of this software were key elements in enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.
            <br><br>

            Throughout my tenure at DogWorld Park, I honed my leadership, problem-solving, and communication skills. These experiences not only contributed to the park's sustained success but also deepened my understanding of effective business management and the pet care industry.          <h3 class="experience__skills">Skills</h3>

      During my time at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I embarked on a transformative journey of learning and discovery. This educational odyssey equipped me with a comprehensive foundation in the field, spanning a multitude of critical areas.
<br><br>

      I delved into the core principles of computer science, immersing myself in the intricacies of computer architecture, logic, and algorithms. My coursework equipped me with a deep understanding of software development methods, including both agile and waterfall techniques, as well as the agile development framework known as Scrum.
      <br><br>

      Software architecture became a fascinating realm of exploration as I honed my skills in UML diagramming and database planning, unraveling the intricate web of structuring and designing software systems.
      <br><br>

      Teamwork was a fundamental aspect of my academic experience. As a member of the "WebDev49" club, I had the opportunity to collaborate on various projects. Notably, I contributed to the digitization of the game "Coup," a project that not only honed my web development skills but also exemplified the power of collective effort in transforming an idea into reality.
      <br><br>

      This collaboration led me to acquire proficiency in a diverse range of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, C#, Ruby, and Python. Moreover, I developed a keen understanding of computer security, engaging in activities such as penetration testing and the development of software with security at its core.
      <br><br>

      Navigating the Linux ecosystem, including the command-line interface, Terminal, and BASH, expanded my expertise in systems administration. I also explored the domain of computer forensics, further enhancing my knowledge of the intricacies of digital investigations and analysis.
      <br><br>

      Networking, in both the technical and social sense, emerged as an essential facet of my education. I grasped the significance of building connections in the industry and honed my knowledge of network infrastructure.
      <br><br>

      One of the highlights of my academic journey was the exploration of the Ruby on Rails framework, which culminated in the creation of a web application reminiscent of Rotten Tomatoes.
      <br><br>

      For my senior project, I undertook an ambitious endeavor by designing a web application that harnessed the capabilities of the Facebook API. This application combed through users' posts to identify and clean any content that might hinder their professional prospects. This project not only showcased my technical acumen but also emphasized the practical and societal impact of technology.
      <br><br>

      My years at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte were marked by academic rigor, creative exploration, and the acquisition of skills that continue to shape my career as a computer scientist. This journey ignited my passion for the field and prepared me for the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation.    <h3 class="experience__skills">Skills</h3>

      <p class="experience__description">
        My pursuit of a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte was a transformative journey that nurtured my capacity for critical thinking and the art of constructing compelling and reasoned arguments. During my years as a philosophy student, I delved deep into the world of ideas, contemplating the complexities of existence, morality, and the human experience.
        <br><br>
        My philosophical studies instilled in me the invaluable skill of critical thinking, which I could apply to the world around me, grounding my arguments in factual material, research articles, and precise definitions. This intellectual discipline honed my ability to analyze, evaluate, and make informed judgments about a multitude of topics.
        <br><br>

        Within my coursework, I explored various philosophical schools of thought, including Idealism, Realism, Pragmatism, and Existentialism. These philosophical paradigms enriched my understanding of diverse perspectives on reality, human nature, and the world's inherent complexities.
        <br><br>

        In a particular course, I dissected the concept of "Americanness" and the United States' identity as a melting pot. I engaged in thoughtful debates and proposed definitions of what it means to be an American, delving into the nation's multifaceted tapestry.
        <br><br>

        In another class, I explored the historical oppression of women, tracing its roots back to colonial times and the pervasive fear of nature. This interconnectedness between history and the human experience unveiled the profound philosophical underpinnings of societal norms and gender dynamics.
        <br><br>

        Challenging my preconceived notions was a recurrent theme in my philosophy studies, particularly when examining topics of religion and morality. I confronted complex moral dilemmas and pondered the nature of human ethics, pushing the boundaries of my understanding.
        <br><br>

        Moreover, I delved into profound philosophical inquiries about the self, the mind, the body, and the very existence of the world itself. These inquiries nurtured my capacity for abstract reasoning and introduced me to the realm of epistemology and metaphysics.
        <br><br>

        Philosophy taught me the art of constructing sound arguments, supported by rational foundations, and fostered a commitment to eradicating skepticism. This enduring commitment to critically assessing and challenging beliefs proved to be a fundamental pillar of my education.
        <br><br>

        Interestingly, the synergy between philosophy and computer science became apparent as I ventured into the realm of software development. The ability to dissect complex problems, break them down into smaller components, and understand the system as a whole was a skill honed in my philosophical studies. I learned the art of argumentation and the profound ability to define and analyze the world around me, skills that proved to be invaluable in the development of software.

                    "Bones" is a six-dice game where players aim to score points by rolling specific combinations and taking calculated risks. Players take turns rolling dice, deciding whether to keep their points or continue rolling. If they fail to roll a scoring combination, they lose their turn's points. The first to reach the winning threshold wins, blending luck and strategy for social fun.

            <p class="aboutMe__description">
              I'm Marco Mercado, a family-oriented individual with a deep passion for various pursuits. Outside of work, my life revolves around my loved ones and a variety of interests. My wife and I are dog enthusiasts, and we're not only dedicated to walking our six furry friends but also passionate about attending seminars and workshops on dog training. We embrace the great outdoors through hiking whenever our schedules permit. Creating memorable moments is another key aspect of our lives. We adore hosting gatherings, including game nights, sports events, and more, for our friends and family. Additionally, my love for soccer takes me to the field regularly; I'm an active player in a local league in Charlotte, where I compete passionately. Staying healthy is a priority for me, and I achieve this through consistent lifting and long-distance running, which keep me in peak condition. In addition, I enjoy working on coding projects and delving into the world of new technologies. It's a space where I can blend creativity and problem-solving. I also lend a helping hand to my wife in our dog training business on the weekends. In my leisure time, I find solace in exploring the vast realm of philosophy and delving into various philosophical texts. Reading is another cherished pastime, allowing me to escape into different worlds and expand my knowledge. This multifaceted lifestyle reflects my commitment to personal growth, community, and the joys of life beyond the workplace.   </p>
